# Publish-Subscribe

> [!CAUTION]
> Every payload you transmit with iceoryx2 must implement [`ZeroCopySend`] to
> be compatible with shared memory.
> Usually, you can use the derive-macro `#[derive(ZeroCopySend)]` for most
> types. If you implement it manually you must ensure that the payload type:
>
> * is self contained, no heap, no pointers to external sources
> * has a uniform memory representation -> `#[repr(C)]`
> * does not use pointers to manage their internal structure
> * and its members don't implement `Drop` explicitly
> * has a `'static` lifetime
>
> Data types like `String` or `Vec` will cause undefined behavior and may
> result in segmentation faults. We provide alternative data types that are
> compatible with shared memory. See the
> [complex data type example](../complex_data_types) for guidance on how to
> use them.

This example illustrates a robust publisher-subscriber messaging pattern
between two separate processes. The publisher sends a message every second,
each containing [`TransmissionData`]. On the receiving end, the subscriber
checks for new data every second.

The subscriber is printing the sample on the console whenever new data arrives.

## How to Run

To observe this dynamic communication in action, open two separate terminals and
execute the following commands:

### Terminal 1

```sh
cargo run --example publish_subscribe_subscriber
```

### Terminal 2

```sh
cargo run --example publish_subscribe_publisher
```

Feel free to run multiple instances of publisher or subscriber processes
simultaneously to explore how iceoryx2 handles publisher-subscriber
communication efficiently.

> [!TIP]
> You may hit the maximum supported number of ports when too many publisher or
> subscriber processes run. Take a look at the
> [iceoryx2 config](../../../config) to set the limits globally or at the
> [API of the Service builder](https://docs.rs/iceoryx2/latest/iceoryx2/service/index.html)
> to set them for a single service.
